EmpowHer - Digitalisation of ledgers of SHG's for women with features for information of schemes, business/job ideas. 

Problem Statement :	Strength in Numbers (Women SHG Digital Empowerment Platform): Like the strength found in community in Stranger Things, Women Self-Help Groups (SHGs) thrive on collaboration. However, many SHGs still lack a reliable digital ecosystem that enables smooth coordination and growth. There is a pressing need for a unified platform that helps SHGs function more efficiently and scale sustainably.

EmpowHer is a digital platform designed to empower Women Self-Help Groups (SHGs) by combining community collaboration, livelihood guidance, financial planning, and access to government schemes into a single, easy-to-use system. Instead of treating SHGs only as savings or loan groups, EmpowHer enables women to identify income-generating skills, plan purpose-driven loans, and grow sustainable micro-enterprises together.

Women Self-Help Groups thrive on collective strength, yet many SHGs face persistent challenges:
-Lack of a structured digital ecosystem for coordination
-Difficulty in deciding what skills or businesses can generate income
-Loans taken without clear income planning, increasing financial risk
-Scattered and inaccessible information about government schemes for women
-Dependence on informal communication and paperwork
Most existing systems focus only on financial transactions, ignoring the decision-making and livelihood planning that determine long-term success.

Through our analysis, we identified that the core issue is not access to credit, but access to clarity.

Women in SHGs often ask:
-What skill or business suits my background and resources?
-How much can I realistically earn?
-How much loan do I actually need?
-Which schemes am I eligible for, and how do I apply?
Without structured guidance, loans are often taken without a clear plan, making growth unsustainable.

EmpowHer addresses this gap by acting as a bridge between skills, income opportunities, loans, and government support.

The platform helps SHG members:
-Identify suitable skills or livelihood options
-Estimate income and startup costs
-Link loan requests to a clear business purpose
-Discover relevant women-focused government schemes
-Strengthen community-driven growth
All features are designed to be simple, explainable, and accessible, especially for low-resource and low-connectivity environments.
